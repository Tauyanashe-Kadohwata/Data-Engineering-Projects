Automated ELT Data Pipeline with Snowflake
Project Overview
This project demonstrates the construction of a fully automated ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) data pipeline using Snowflake. The pipeline ingests raw customer data, transforms it for analysis, and schedules the entire process to run on a regular basis, ensuring the data is always up-to-date. The final, transformed data is ready for business intelligence (BI) and reporting.

Architecture
The data pipeline follows a simple and effective three-stage ELT process:

Extract & Load: Raw data from a CSV file is loaded directly into a staging table in Snowflake.

Transform: SQL is used to clean, standardize, and enrich the raw data. A new, transformed table is created for downstream consumption.

Automate & Display: A Snowflake Task is set up to automate the transformation query on a regular schedule. The final results are displayed in a Snowflake Dashboard for visualization.

# Key Features
Data Ingestion: Successfully loaded raw data into a Snowflake table.

Data Transformation: Utilized SQL CASE statements and other functions to clean and standardize the billing_cycle column.

Pipeline Automation: Created a Snowflake Task to run the transformation query on a 15-minute schedule, creating a hands-free, automated pipeline.

Data Visualization: The transformed data is structured for easy analysis and visualization in dashboards.

Technologies Used
Snowflake: Cloud data warehouse used for all data storage, processing, and pipeline automation.

SQL: The primary language for all data transformation and task creation logic.

Power BI: A business intelligence tool (used externally) to connect to the final Snowflake table for visualization and reporting.

# How to Run This Project
To replicate this project in your own Snowflake environment:

Upload the CSV: Upload the beta_connect_data.csv file into a table in your Snowflake database.

Copy and Paste: Copy all of the SQL queries from the SQL Queries section above.

Execute: Paste the code into a single Snowflake worksheet and run it. This will create the transformed table and the automated task.
