Project Workflow

The architecture follows a simple, robust "Bronze-to-Silver" model, with Power BI acting as the final Gold/Analytics layer.

Bronze Layer (Raw Data): The raw Video Games Data.csv is uploaded to a Databricks Volume to act as the "data lake."

Silver Layer (Transformed Data): A Delta Live Tables (DLT) pipeline (dlt_pipeline_corrected.py) automatically reads this raw data, cleans it, casts data types, handles nulls, and saves the result as a new Delta table named processed_games.

Gold Layer (Analytics): Power BI connects directly to the Databricks SQL Warehouse, imports the clean processed_games table, and presents a series of interactive dashboards for business analysis.

Technologies Used

Data Platform: Databricks

ETL Framework: Delta Live Tables (DLT) with Python (PySpark)

Data Storage: Databricks Volumes (for raw files), Delta Lake (for managed tables)

Business Intelligence: Power BI Desktop

Final Dashboards & Analysis

The final Power BI report analyzes sales trends, regional performance, and the relationship between critic scores and sales.
